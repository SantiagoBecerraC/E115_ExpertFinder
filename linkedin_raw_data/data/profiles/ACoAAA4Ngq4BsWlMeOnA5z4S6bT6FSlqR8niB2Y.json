The model serves as a test for topological electron Hamiltonian developed in last work. We showed how the results for electron system can be used to predict the results for mechanical system. We first studied 1D system with open edges and compared with the preliminary experimental data, which reveals consistency between theory and experiments, in particular the frequency and vibrational mode of edge modes. Encourages by the agreement, we carried out calculations for 2D systems, which correspond to 2D electron system studied in last work, and made predictions. From the calculations, flat frequency bands are found in the bulk frequency band gap, localized at open edges of a ribbon. We calculated how the group velocity for these bands depend on the width of the ribbon, which can be compared with future experiments.",

Topological origins of these flat bands are analyzed for an electronic system as a specific example, using a two-dimensional extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian with alternating shift of the chains. It is demonstrated that the slow group velocities of the localized flat band states are sensitively controlled by the distance between the boundaries and the propagation can be guided through designed paths of these boundaries. We also discuss how to realize this model in metamaterials.",

                "description": "The rapid progress in quantum computing has opened up new possibilities for tackling complex scientific problems. Variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) holds the potential to solve quantum chemistry problems and achieve quantum advantages. However, the measurement step within the VQE framework presents challenges. It can introduce noise and errors while estimating the objective function with a limited measurement budget. Such error can slow down or prevent the convergence of VQE. To reduce measurement error, many repeated measurements are needed to average out the noise in the objective function. By consolidating Hamiltonian terms into cliques, simultaneous measurements can be performed, reducing the overall measurement shot count. However, limited prior knowledge of each clique, such as noise level of measurement, poses a challenge. This work introduces two shot assignment strategies based on estimating the standard deviation of measurements to improve the convergence of VQE and reduce the required number of shots. These strategies specifically target two distinct scenarios: over-allocated and under-allocated shots. The efficacy of the optimized shot assignment strategy is demonstrated through numerical experiments conducted on a H2 molecule. This research contributes to the advancement of VQE as a practical tool for solving quantum chemistry problems, paving the way for future applications in complex scientific simulations on quantum computers.",

While there is evidence suggesting that the fixed form of the original QAOA ansatz is not optimal, there is no systematic approach for finding better ansätze. We address this problem by developing an iterative version of QAOA that is problem-tailored, and which can also be adapted to specific hardware constraints. We simulate the algorithm on a class of Max-Cut graph problems and show that it converges much faster than the original QAOA, while simultaneously reducing the required number of CNOT gates and optimization parameters.",

                "description": "Many classical optimization problems can be mapped to finding the ground states of diagonal Ising Hamiltonians, for which variational quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provide heuristic methods. Because the solutions of such classical optimization problems are necessarily product states, it is unclear how entanglement affects their performance. An Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored (ADAPT) variation of QAOA improves the convergence rate by allowing entangling operations in the mixer layers whereas it requires fewer CNOT gates in the entire circuit. In this work, we study the entanglement generated during the execution of ADAPT-QAOA. Through simulations of the weighted Max-Cut problem, we show that ADAPT-QAOA exhibits substantial flexibility in entangling and disentangling qubits. By incrementally restricting this flexibility, we find that a larger amount of entanglement entropy at earlier stages coincides with faster convergence at later stages. In contrast, while the standard QAOA quickly generates entanglement within a few layers, it cannot remove excess entanglement efficiently. Our results offer implications for favorable features of quantum optimization algorithms.",

However, many algorithms for preparing Gibbs states rely on quantum subroutines which are difficult to implement on near-term hardware. Here, we address this by (i) introducing an objective function that, unlike the free energy, is easily measured, and (ii) using dynamically generated, problem-tailored ansätze. This allows for arbitrarily accurate Gibbs state preparation using low-depth circuits. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we numerically demonstrate that our algorithm can prepare high-fidelity Gibbs states across a broad range of temperatures and for a variety of Hamiltonians.",

Ahn, Phys. Rev. B 99, 041117(R)\n(2019)], we experimentally and computationally demonstrate that topological flat frequency bands\ncan occur at open edges of 2D planar metamaterials and at antiphase boundary seams of ring-shaped\nor tubular metamaterials. Specifically, using mechanical systems made of magnetically coupled\nspinners, we reveal that the presence of the edge or seam bands that are flat in the entire projected\nreciprocal space follows the predictions based on topological winding numbers. The edge-to-edge\ndistance sensitively controls the flatness of the edge bands and the localization of excitations. The\nanalogue of the fractional charge state is also observed. Possible realizations of flat bands in a large\nclass of metamaterials, including photonic crystals and electronic metamaterials, are discussed.",

The efficiency of\nthis algorithm depends crucially on the ability to prepare multi-qubit trial states on the quantum\nprocessor that either include, or at least closely approximate, the actual energy eigenstates of the\nproblem being simulated while avoiding states that have little overlap with them. Symmetries play a\ncentral role in determining the best trial states. Here, we present efficient state preparation circuits\nthat respect particle number, total spin, spin projection, and time-reversal symmetries. These\ncircuits contain the minimal number of variational parameters needed to fully span the appropriate\nsymmetry subspace dictated by the chemistry problem while avoiding all irrelevant sectors of Hilbert\nspace. We show how to construct these circuits for arbitrary numbers of orbitals, electrons, and spin\nquantum numbers, and we provide explicit decompositions and gate counts in terms of standard\ngate sets in each case.",

Topological origins of these flatbands are\nanalyzed for an electronic system as a specific example, using a two-dimensional extension of the Su-SchriefferHeeger Hamiltonian with alternating shift of the chains. It is demonstrated that the slow group velocities of the\nlocalized flat band states are sensitively controlled by the distance between the boundaries and the propagation\ncan be guided through designed paths of these boundaries. We also discuss how to realize this model in\nmetamaterials.",

Simulations based on a tight-binding\nHamiltonian and Boltzmann equations reveal partially decoupled oscillations of the electronic\norder parameter and the periodic lattice distortion during CO melting, which becomes more energy\nefficient with lower photon energy. The cooling rate of the electron system correlates with the CO\ngap dynamics, responsible for an order of magnitude decrease in the cooling rate upon the gap\nreopening. We also find that the time-dependent frequency of coherent oscillation reflects the\ndynamics of the energy landscape, such as transition between single-well and double-well, which\nsensitively depends on the photon energy and the pump fluence. The results demonstrate the intricate nonequilibrium dynamics in CO materials. ",

As with any variational approach, itsperformance depends sensitively on the selection of an appropriate variational form. Recentwork has detailed the effectiveness of ADAPT-VQE, an adaptive approach to VQE in which thevariational form is grown iteratively, resulting in ansatze which yield high performance withminimal numbers of variational parameters. This approach, however, is quantum resourceintensive, requiring many quantum circuit executions and state measurements to grow theansatze. Here we present RNN-VQE, a machine learning model which uses recurrent neuralnetworks to learn and quickly generate effective variational ansatze for VQE",

However, many algorithms for preparing Gibbs states rely on quantum subroutines which are difficult to implement on near-term hardware. Here, we address this by (i) introducing an objective function that, unlike the free energy, is easily measured and (ii) using dynamically generated, problem-tailored ansatze. This allows for arbitrarily accurate Gibbs state preparation using low-depth circuits. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we numerically demonstrate that our algorithm can prepare high-fidelity Gibbs states across a broad range of temperatures and for a variety of Hamiltonians.",
