This paper introduces the first implementation of a hybrid and customized evolutionary multi-objective (EMO) algorithm to improve the Chesapeake Bay Watershed's (CBW) water quality. To make the algorithm scalable, we inject a few solutions obtained using an integer programming algorithm (IPOPT) in the initial population of EMO. Also, a repair operator is applied to satisfy every equality constraint. Combining these approaches can find a set of non-dominated trade-off solutions from 1,012 variables (Tucker county in West Virginia) to a staggering 153,818 variable problem (the whole state of West Virginia). Furthermore, a pre-liminary analysis of obtained trade-off solutions finds interesting properties of BMP allocations, providing an optimistic picture of applying the proposed customized optimization algorithm in addressing other bigger states leading to the whole Chesapeake Bay watershed.",

                "description": "This article presents a Dendrite Morphological Neuron model learned by Linkage Trees (LT-DMN). It is presented as an alternative to modern DMN model training approaches based on k-means clustering that must tune the number of dendrites per class by defining a k-value. Also, the k-means based methods have a problem of non-reproducibility and, for each potential solution, they may present the risk of falling into local minima. The LT-DMN algorithm selects the centroids from a deterministic hierarchical clustering, which builds a linkage tree for each class of patterns. In addition, the simulated annealing algorithm is used to automatically fit a suitable cut-off point in the structure of each tree that minimizes the classification error and the number of dendrites. The proposed method is evaluated on nine synthetic data sets and 17 real-world problems. The results reveal that the proposed method is competitive or even better than seven DMN models from the literature. Furthermore, LT-DMN achieves low architectural complexity by using few dendrites.",

                "description": "The generation of massive amounts of data has motivated the use of machine learning models to perform predictive analysis. However, the computational complexity of these algorithms depends mainly on the number of training samples. Thus, training predictive models with high generalization performance within a reasonable computing time is a challenging problem. Instance selection (IS) can be applied to remove unnecessary points based on a specific criterion to reduce the training time of predictive models. This paper introduces an evolutionary IS algorithm that employs a novel fitness function to maximize the similarity of the probability density function (PDF) between the original dataset and the selected subset, and to minimize the number of samples chosen. This method is compared against six other IS algorithms using four performance measures relating to the accuracy, reduction rate, PDF preservation, and efficiency (which combines the first three indices using a geometric mean). Experiments with 40 datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms its counterparts. The selected instances are also used to train seven classifiers, in order to evaluate the generalization and reusability of this approach. Finally, the accuracy results show that the proposed approach is competitive with other methods and that the selected instances have adequate capabilities for reuse in different classifiers.",

                "description": "In this study, we developed a framework for the selection and placement of the most cost-effective sets of Best Management Practices (BMPs) within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed to simultaneously reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment delivery to water bodies. This framework was built upon the Interior Point Optimizer nonlinear programming algorithm, designed to find local solutions to constrained optimization problems. To speed up the search process, we incorporated an approach based on Pareto optimality to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization problem and considered explicit acreage limits for BMPs allocation. The optimization algorithm was linked to the Chesapeake Assessment Scenario Tool (CAST) to simulate the effects of BMPs on water quality. The mathematical formulation of CAST allowed us to analytically derive gradient information (i.e., Jacobian and Hessian matrices). We compared our framework, written in C++, against an existing framework written in Python without dimensionality reduction or user-provided gradient information. Results revealed a substantial improvement in convergence, computation time, and the number of function evaluations when using the newly developed framework. Furthermore, optimized solutions showed lower implementation costs and pollutant loads compared to current watershed implementation plan scenarios. These improvements represent an opportunity to analyze different watershed management scenarios. In addition, launching the new framework within a web-based decision support tool will facilitate the dialogue among stakeholders, which ultimately will result in the overall improvement of water quality in the Bay and its tributaries.",

This problem can be overcome with instance selection (IS) to obtain a subset of patterns that keep the original underlying distribution. IS has been often addressed as an optimization problem solved by evolutionary algorithms, which usually adopt a binary representation to encode all the instances explicitly; hence, the larger the number of instances, the greater the search space. We propose an IS method based on linkage trees, where cut-off levels per class are encoded to reduce the search space. Thus, the codification length equals the number of classes, which is considerably smaller than the binary codification size. Clusters of instances are created from cut-off levels, and their medoids form the selected subset of instances. The linkage trees cut-off levels are optimized by simulated annealing to find the best subset of instances that preserves the original data distribution with a reduced number of instances. The experimental results on synthetic and realworld datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms IS methods from the literature regarding a tradeoff between classification accuracy, reduction rate, and density preservation.",

                "description": "Software pipelines enable organizations to chain applications for adding value to contents (e.g., confidentially, reliability, and integrity) before either sharing them with partners or sending them to the cloud. However, the pipeline components add overhead when processing large volumes of data, which can become critical in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a gearbox model for processing large volumes of data by using pipeline systems encapsulated into virtual containers. In this model, the gears represent applications, whereas gearboxes represent software pipelines. This model was implemented as a collaborative system that automatically performs Gear up (by using parallel patterns) and/or Gear down (by using in-memory storage) until all gears produce uniform data processing velocities. This model reduces delays and bottlenecks produced by the heterogeneous performance of applications included in software pipelines. The new container tool \n has been designed to encapsulate both the collaborative system and the software pipelines into a virtual container and deploy it on IT infrastructures. We conducted case studies to evaluate the performance of \n when processing medical images and PDF repositories. The incorporation of a capsule to a cloud storage service for pre-processing medical imagery was also studied. The experimental evaluation revealed the feasibility of applying the gearbox model to the deployment of software pipelines in real-world scenarios as it can significantly improve the end-user service experience when pre-processing large-scale data in comparison with state-of-the-art solutions such as Sacbe and Parsl.",

                "description": "Weight adaptation methods can enhance the diversity of solutions obtained by decomposition-based approaches when addressing irregular Pareto front shapes. Generally, these methods adapt the location of each weight vector during the search process. However, early adaptation could be unnecessary and ineffective because the population does not provide a good Pareto front approximation at early generations. In order to improve its performance, a better approach would be to trigger such adaptation only when the population has reached the Pareto front. In this paper, we introduce a performance indicator to assist weight adaptation methods, called the median of dispersion of the population (MDP). The proposed indicator provides a general snapshot of the progress of the population toward the Pareto front by analyzing the local progress of each subproblem. When the population becomes steady according to the proposed indicator, the adaptation of weight vectors starts. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in both regular and irregular test problems. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach triggers the weight adaptation when it is needed.",

                "description": "One of the main difficulties in applying an optimization algorithm to a practical problem is that evaluation of objectives and constraints often involve computationally expensive procedures. To handle such problems, a metamodel is first formed from a few exact (high-fidelity) solution evaluations and then optimized by an algorithm in a progressive manner. However, in solving multiobjective or many-objective optimization problems involving multiple constraints, a simple extension of the idea to form one metamodel for each objective and constraint function may not constitute the most efficient approach. The cumulative effect of errors from each metamodel may turn out to be detrimental for the accuracy of the overall optimization procedure. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of different plausible metamodeling frameworks for multiobjective and many-objective optimization and provide a comparative study by discussing advantages and disadvantages of each framework. The results presented in this paper are obtained using the well-known Kriging metamodeling approach. Based on our extensive simulation studies on proposed frameworks, we report intriguing observations about the behavior of each framework, which may provide salient guidelines for further studies in this emerging area within evolutionary multiobjective optimization.",

                "description": "This paper presents a hybrid approach that combines an evolutionary algorithm with a classical multi-objective optimization technique to incorporate the preferences of the decision maker into the search process. The preferences are given as a vector of goals, which represent the desirable values for each objective. The proposed approach enhances the goal-constraint technique in such a way that, instead of use the provided ε\nε\n values to compute the upper bounds of the restated problem, it uses only the information of the vector of goals to generate the constraints. The bounds of the region of interest are obtained using an efficient constrained evolutionary optimization algorithm. Then, an interpolation method is placed in charge of populating such a region. It is worth noting that although goal-constraint is able to obtain the bounds of problems regardless of their number objectives, the interpolation method adopted in this paper is restricted to bi-objective problems. The proposed approach was validated using problems from the ZDT, DTLZ, and WFG benchmarks. In addition, it was compared with two well-known algorithms that use the g-dominance approach to incorporate the preferences of the decision maker. The results corroborate that the incorporation of a priori preferences into the proposed approach is useful to direct the search efforts towards the decision’s maker region of interest.",

Nevertheless, recent analysis demonstrates that the performance of VNE solutions in key metrics like virtualized network acceptance ratio decreases drastically with medium-to-large sizes of substrate and virtual networks. This paper proposes a constraint management approach that grades the quality of VNE candidate solutions according to the degree of fulfillment of their constraints and exploits this information to drive the metaheuristics to more promising regions of the search process enhancing their performance. Through simulation and formal statistical analysis, our approach has been proved to enhance VNE acceptance ratio practically at no time overhead. Formal statistical analysis and comparison with the literature demonstrate that our approach enhances the quality of embeddings and that such enhancements are more accentuated in large sizes of substrate networks, where the performance of standard metaheuristics decreases drastically.",

The Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN) conference is held at the same period (early fall), but even years. EA is dedicated to techniques that simulate natural evolution.\nProceedings of AE are published by Springer-Verlag in their LNCS serie.\nArtificial Evolution was originally initiated as a forum for the French-speaking evolutionary computation community, and the first conference, organized by Jean-Marc Alliot, Evelyne Lutton, Edmund Ronald and Marc Schoenauer, was held in Toulouse in 1994 under the name Evolution Artificielle. It is the only conference held an even year, and the only one with proceedings[1]not edited by Springer (they were edited by Cepadues[2]). It became an international conference the following year (1995) in Brest, under the name Artificial Evolution. It is still referred sometimes as Evolution Artificielle however.",
