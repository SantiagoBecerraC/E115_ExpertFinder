        "summary": "I’m never afraid to try something new. After building a strong foundation as a Java software developer, I channeled that knowledge in new ways: first I was a teacher, then I developed a software tool for veterinary schools, then I engineered software and applied Agile principles in the corporate world. I honed my leadership skills in Target’s Engineering Management Immersion Program. Now, with artificial intelligence and machine learning monopolizing the horizon, I’m learning to use data science to enhance the entire software engineering workflow.\n\nMY CAREER STORY\nEarly in my career, I taught at a top-tier liberal arts college (Washington and Lee), but I learned that I’d rather be developing software instead of teaching students to do it. I joined the Bioinformatics Research Group, first at Virginia Tech and then at Iowa State, and engineered a software tool deployed at 5 of North America’s top veterinary schools. \n\nWhen that project’s funding ran out, I tried my hand in the corporate world as a software developer and Agile coach. I channeled my software skills into product management for a mobile device that utilizes augmented reality; we released on iOS, Android, HoloLens, Microsoft OS, and smart glasses. I completed Target’s Engineering Management Immersion Program, which honed my leadership skills – and helped me determine that I’m better suited to hands-on design and development than to a strictly management job. I can manage and/or coach others on the entire software development life cycle, from requirements gathering through deployment and upgrade.\n\nMY NEXT ADVENTURE\nI started studying machine learning in 2017 and have continued to pursue ML while launching and directing a team at Target to compile “small” engineering data, distill insights, and create visualizations with a GraphQL API. I now support other Target teams’ data science initiatives. As I continue to broaden my knowledge of machine learning, Google Cloud Platform, VertexAI, and Python, I strive to:\n\n✵ Deliver automated, repeatable processes to enable data scientists to rapidly iterate on and deploy their models.  \n✵ Expand my understanding of data science models, their construction, and their uses.\n✵ Dive into the mathematical foundations underlying AI/ML models and use my math skills to make adjustments at the model level to optimize outcomes. \n\nABOUT ME\nWhen I’m not at work, you might find me bicycling, reading, or on my farm with my sheep, ducks, cats, and dogs. I love training my dogs to perform tricks, herd, and dance – yes, dance!",
