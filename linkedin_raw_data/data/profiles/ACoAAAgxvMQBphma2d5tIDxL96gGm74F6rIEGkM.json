        "summary": "Salih Tutun is an award-winning AI researcher and faculty member at the Olin Business School, and Institute for Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis. His research is about designing and developing Explainable AI artifacts in business. His work bridges the gap between generative AI research and real-world business applications, creating impactful solutions across various domains.\n\nSalih has received multiple awards for his excellence in teaching and research. He is a four-time recipient of the Reid Teaching Award (2021, 2022, and 2023) at Olin Business School. His research on Networked Pattern Recognition (NEPAR) garnered over 9 million clicks in two months, featured by more than 40 global news organizations, and appeared on the cover of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Work magazine. He was a finalist in the IISE Cup Competitions in 2020 and 2021 and won the Gold Award at the 2023 IISE Cup for his work on MDScan and keep going to work on XScanner. Also, in 2024, he received the Olin Research Award and won Runner Up Award in the INFORMS Data Mining Best Paper Competition.\n\nSalih’s research contributions include developing AI tools for diagnosing mental disorders, understanding human behaviors, optimizing business strategies, and improving decision-making. His key projects include:\n\n- MDScan: A mental disorder screening solution using clinical data and XAI.\n- XScanner: An AI tool transforming structured data into interpretable diagnostic images.\n- NEPAR: A pattern recognition approach for large-scale network data.\n- SASX: An AI tool for diagnosing ADHD using dynamic attention assessment.\n- DIA: A dynamic tool for diagnosing multiple mental disorders with human-in-the-loop feedback.\n- DemansCheck: A digital test for early detection of dementia using gamification.\n- DeepScreen: A digital artifact to make a anonymization of any dataset for information privacy. \n\nSalih’s work aims to make AI transparent, ethical, and aligned with human values. He collaborates with Washington University, DNB Analytics, and industry partners to apply his research in healthcare, HR, marketing, and finance. His research shows how AI can enhance business outcomes and offer insights into psychosocial behavior.\n\nCurrently, Salih is developing new XAI methodologies, human-in-the-loop frameworks, and AI tools for explainable decision-making. He envisions a future where AI is transparent, trustworthy, and aligned with strategic business goals.\n\nFor more on his publications and projects, visit https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Salih-Tutun-2.",

                "description": "Terrorism  is  a  complex  phenomenon  with  high  uncertainty  of  user  strategies.  The  uncertain  nature of terrorism is the main challenge in the design of counter-terrorism policy. Government agencies  (e.g.,  CIA,  FBI,  NSA,  etc.)  cannot  always  use  social  media  and  telecommunication  to  capture  intentions  of  terrorists  because  terrorists  are  more  careful  in  the  utilization  of  these  environments for planning and preparing for attacks. To address this issue, this research aims to propose  a  comprehensive  new  framework, namely  Networked  Pattern  Recognition  (NEPAR)  Framework,  by  defining  the  useful  patterns  of  attacks  to  understand  behaviors,  to  analyze  the  terrorist  activity  patterns  and  relations,  to  predict  their  future  moves,  and  finally  to  prevent  and  detect potential terrorist behaviors.  In the framework, there are two main phases: (1) building networks by finding relations among the  events,  and  (2)  using  a  unified  detection  approach  that  combines  the  proposed  network  topology  and  pattern  recognition  approaches.  More  specifically,  the  proposed  framework  first  identifies relevant features using a proposed Networked Feature Selection (NFS) method and the Optimized  Robust  Logistic  Regression  (ORLR)  model.  It  then  calculates  the  relationship  between  selected  features,  via  a  new  similarity  (interaction)  measure,  which  is  capable  of  handling both categorical and numerical features. Therefore, we form a new network model and analyze  the  structure  of  relations  to  infer  knowledge  about  terrorist  attacks.  Moreover,  a  graph-based  outbreak  detection  (as  a  spatial  network)  is  proposed  to  define  dangerous  places  for  the  outbreak of violence. You can read the file for more...\n\n",

These models can be utilized by a group of collaborating entities in emergency situations to decide how they share resources and mitigate adverse effects on human lives. Due to the sudden spikes in demand, the allocation of healthcare resources becomes dynamic in nature. Medical resource management underwent an unprecedented level of difficulty in the modern history of our healthcare system because of the Coronavirus pandemic. At the beginning of the pandemic, we witnessed a severe shortage of ventilators in several countries including in the U.S. Followed by that, there was a severe shortage of Oxygen supply in treating patients who tested positive for the virus in India. Many lives were unnecessarily lost because of the lack of a resource-sharing framework to use in an adverse situation. When a hospital or region experiences sudden spikes in demand for resources, the key decision involves sending resources from other places. Especially, a swift optimal decision has to be made regarding who will send the resources and when will it be sent to the places of need. To tackle this problem, we developed three analytics models—MILP, DQL, and DDQL—based on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)’s public data of ventilator allocation. ",
