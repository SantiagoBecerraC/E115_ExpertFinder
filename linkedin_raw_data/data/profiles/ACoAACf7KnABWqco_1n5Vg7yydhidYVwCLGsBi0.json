The project aimed to integrate and analyze diverse weather datasets to improve prediction accuracy and optimize agricultural outputs.\nKey Contributions:\n1. Integrated NASA Power API and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) data, improving the accuracy of weather predictions by calibrating global datasets with localized anchor points.\n2. Employed Ridge regression, Linear Regression, Lasso regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to benchmark weather conditions and optimize crop yield predictions.\n3. Developed predictive models that significantly enhanced the applicability of weather data for precision agriculture, facilitating better strategic crop selection and agricultural planning.\n4. Led a team of 4 to design and implement data-driven agricultural solutions, improving crop yield by 20% and reducing water usage by 15%.\n5. Analyzed sensor data from 100+ devices to monitor soil moisture, temperature, and crop health.\n6. Developed predictive models for crop disease forecasting, minimizing potential losses by 10%.\nPresented findings to stakeholders, securing approval for advanced analytics implementation in farming operations.",

Developing a model which correctly predicts the value or selling price for your asset (house) considering all the characteristics and factors is important.\n\nMethodology:-\nComplete use of SEEMA data modeling method with using SAS, Tableau, and Alteryx as the computational tools.\nUsing a combination of the following statistical and data mining techniques to analyze, train and validate the given data set:-\nData exploration and modification:- Data visualization (Tableau), Variable Encoding, outlier impacts\nVariable selection:- PCA, Multiple Regression (LASSO), Stepwise selection\nModeling:- Clustering, Multiple Regression.\nAnalysis and Validation:- Adjusted R square, AIC.\n\nUsing the insights from modeling to answer the following business questions:-\n\n1)What factors influence the price of a house?\n2)What is the expected selling price of a home?\n3)Which factors are more important than others? \n4)Which homes should the client compare their house to?\n5)When is the best time of the year to sell the house? \n6)How much should one invest in improving the condition of his/her house to increase the expected price by more than the cost of improvements?",

I have examine the diagnosis of diabetes to logistic regression and box plot graphs.\nResearch Questions:\n1. What factors influence the prediction of diabetic patient.\n2. What factors are more important than others\n3. Which symptoms do patients have to concentrate more on like which have more chances of having diabetes\n4.
