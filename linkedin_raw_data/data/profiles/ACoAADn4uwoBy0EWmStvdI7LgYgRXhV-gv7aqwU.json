        "summary": "I'm an Applied Data Scientist with over 3 years of experience developing and optimizing AI-driven solutions, specializing in machine learning, NLP, and Copilot-like AI applications. I have deep expertise in transformer-based models (GPT-4, T5, BERT, Gemini), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reinforcement learning (RLHF), and hyperparameter tuning. My experience includes deploying scalable AI models in cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure) and working with big data analytics, ETL pipelines, and AI explainability (SHAP, LIME). Currently, I am an Associate Data Scientist at Yellow Parka Labs, where I build intelligent AI solutions that enhance user experiences. I also have experience in MLOps & Model Deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, FastAPI, MLflow), database management (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka), and data visualization (Tableau, Power BI, Google Analytics).\n\nI hold a Master’s in Data Science from George Washington University and am currently enrolled in Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Professional Program, further deepening my expertise in Deep Learning, Multi-Task Learning, and Generative AI. With strong programming skills in Python, R, SQL, JavaScript, C++, and Matlab, I am passionate about building scalable, explainable, and high-performance AI systems that drive business impact. Let’s connect and explore opportunities in AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning!",
