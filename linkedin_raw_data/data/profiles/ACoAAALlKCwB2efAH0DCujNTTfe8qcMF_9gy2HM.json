        "summary": "Dr. Krishnaram Kenthapadi has over a 20-year record of advancing new research areas, identifying early trends in AI/ML & influencing thought leadership in industry, shaping the technical vision, development & launch of new AI products, and steering company-wide initiatives in new domains. As the Chief Scientist, Clinical AI at Oracle Health, he leads the AI initiatives for Clinical AI Agent & other Oracle Health products. Previously, as the Chief AI Officer & Chief Scientist of Fiddler AI, he led initiatives on generative AI, AI safety, observability & trustworthiness. Previously, he led the responsible AI initiatives in Amazon AWS AI platform, and shaped new initiatives such as Amazon SageMaker Clarify from inception to launch. Before that, he was part of the LinkedIn AI team, where he led a large-scale responsible AI deployment in industry (fairness-aware LinkedIn Talent Search), incubated responsible AI initiatives, and shaped the scientific roadmap for new products such as LinkedIn Salary, and prior to that, he was a researcher at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley Lab.\n\nKrishnaram has advanced the state-of-the-art in areas such as fairness, explainability, privacy, and robustness in ML, and helped start new research areas (e.g., co-authoring the second paper on Differential Privacy). Leveraging his expertise in research and industry, he has steered company-wide initiatives on responsible AI and AI observability, led the technical roadmap/design/launch of new AI products, and improved existing products via technology transfers. His work has been recognized through awards at NAACL, WWW, SODA, CIKM, ICML AutoML workshop, and Microsoft’s AI/ML conference (MLADS). He has published 60+ papers, with 7500+ citations and filed 150+ patents (71 granted). He has given several invited industry talks, presented tutorials on privacy, fairness, explainable AI, model monitoring, responsible AI, and generative AI at forums such as ICML, KDD, WSDM, WWW, FAccT, and AAAI, and instructed a course on responsible AI at Stanford, thereby influencing industry thinking, thought leadership, and practice in his areas of work.\n\nAreas: Health AI, Trustworthy Generative AI, AI Observability, AI Safety, Fairness/Transparency/Explainability/Privacy in AI/ML systems, Algorithms for Large Datasets and Graphs, Data Mining, Web Search, Information Retrieval, Search and Recommendation Systems, Social Network Analysis, Computational Education.\n\nPlease visit his personal homepage (https://cs.stanford.edu/people/kngk) for more information on recent projects, publications & patents.",

This involved balancing the needs of privacy and modeling, and bridging the large gap between the security and engineering teams.\n- Designed a privacy-preserving data-processing pipeline to ensure that individual salaries are not discoverable. This involved encrypting/de-identifying different aspects of the data at different stages so that there is no single point of failure, and the design is robust to any potential storage/service breaches.\n- Designed and implemented an extensible and robust salary modeling rest.li API, considering the initial product needs (incentive for data collection) as well as subsequent scenarios (basis for LinkedIn Salary product and use as a platform for other LinkedIn verticals). Designed schemas for multiple Voldemort distributed key-value stores to support the Rest.Li interface and the offline aggregation flow. These designs helped bring more stability to the overall software design, which tended to evolve with the UI design.\n- Developed and deployed AI/statistical models to measure/improve data quality. The modeling efforts included outlier detection, regression models for estimating compensation, Bayesian hierarchical smoothing, low rank matrix factorization/completion, propensity modeling for bias correction, and addressing numerous conceptual issues such as coverage vs quality trade-off and mapping external datasets to LinkedIn taxonomy.\n- LinkedIn Engineering Blog Posts.\n- Papers on the statistical modeling system (ACM KDD'18 & CIKM'17 *Best Case Studies Paper Award*) and the privacy architecture (IEEE PAC'17).\n- Filed 42 patents.",

Developed techniques for algorithmically identifying and ranking these groups, and performed large scale evaluation over one year of tweets.",

Specifically, we have developed a diagnostic tool for authors and educators to identify weaknesses in a textbook. We have also developed algorithmic and data mining techniques for augmenting different sections of a textbook with links to selective web content (web articles, images & videos) and providing easy access to concepts explained elsewhere in the book that are necessary for understanding the present section. We have built a demonstration of the ideas running on Windows 8 devices as well as on Aakash, the low cost tablet being developed by the Indian government for distribution to millions of students. We showcased our technology and Aakash app (by invitation) to India's Ministry of Human Resource and Development, towards the goal of deploying our app on millions of Aakash tablets.",

With printed books being digitized, as is, we address the following question: How do we enrich the experience of reading from electronic versions of printed books/documents, on cloud-connected tablets? Towards this goal, as a team, we have developed approaches for enriching documents by first understanding the semantics of the content, and using that representation to algorithmically augment a non-fiction book with links to selective web content such as text, images and videos, at any desired granularity. We have incorporated these technologies into a Windows 8 app as well as a web app. These apps are serviced off a Microsoft Azure cloud service that automatically identifies relevant content to augment the book. The app is in the last stage of being released to the Windows App Store. We also transferred the book augmentation technology in the form of the code, necessary data, and documentation to the Office Reader team. Our work enabled the product team to endow the Office Reader with a differentiating capability, and helped enhance the e-reader demos shown to Bill Gates and other top Microsoft executives.",

My solution is simple to state and thus practical, yet non-trivial to analyze. Showed how search queries, clicks and their perturbed counts can be released in a privacy-preserving manner and further that the released data can be used for important practical applications such as helping online advertising campaigns and social science research to understand human nature. [WWW 2009 Best Paper Award Finalist]. Subsequently, invented a method for privacy preserving distance estimation that involves projecting each user's representation into a random, lower-dimensional space via a sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform and then adding Gaussian noise to each entry of the lower-dimensional representation. Provided consultation to a product team in Microsoft, highlighting privacy leaks in the data that was planned to be released, thereby saving Microsoft from a huge PR fiasco.",

                "description": "Worked on challenging problems in the areas of relevance and ranking for web search, and engaged with Bing Search product team to transfer the results of the investigations. Examples of investigations included designing a dynamic ranker with a pruned set of most important features, improving the quality of results for specific classes of queries by designing special rankers, and automatic generation of large amounts of training data from search logs. Showed that temporally relevant and user intent aware labeled training data can be generated automatically by aggregating click activity of hundreds of millions of users, by first forming a preference graph using a probabilistic interpretation of the click log and then formulating as a novel graph partitioning problem. This investigation enabled Bing to deploy country/locale specific rankers in over 25 international markets. Received multiple \"Ship It\" awards for my contributions to web search ranking and relevance improvements in Bing.",
